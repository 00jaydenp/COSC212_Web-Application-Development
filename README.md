# COSC212 Web Application Development


COSC212 focuses mainly on programming techniques for creating dynamic Web pages. These techniques allow you to create Web pages which respond to user input, can store and process information, and generally behave like other applications. This focus on programming is reflected in the structure of the course, which is based around laboratory exercises and practical assignments.

Although many of the concepts you will learn in COMP112 may be applied to any development environment, you will also learn some of the most popular Web development languages. For client-side programming we will use JavaScript, and you will learn how to make Ajax calls to retrieve data from a server and use the jQuery library to write short, descriptive code. On the server-side we will use PHP, which is the most commonly used server-side scripting language, and you will be introduced to SQL through the MySQL database management system
